olsen (deprecated)
=====

Olsen is a node app that takes asynchronous responsive screenshots of various designated sites at defined resolutions.  It is very much out of date and should just be used as a proof of concept for an idea.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. `npm install`

3. Edit `sites.json` and change the site URLs and resolutions to whatever you need.

4. `grunt capture`, screenshots will be output to a `screens/#site_name/` folder.
